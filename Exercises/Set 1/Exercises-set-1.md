1. Looping a triangle
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
```js
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```
It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

2. FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz"for numbers divisible by only one of those).

3. Maximum
Math.max returns its largest argument. We can build something like that now. Write a function findMax that takes three arguments and returns their maxiumum. Without method Math.max method.
```js
console.log(findMax(0, 10, 5));
10
console.log(findMax(0, -10,-2));
0
```
